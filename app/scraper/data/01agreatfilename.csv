59477192,Rat Terrier,Small,Male,Young,Short, Batman ,,True,,False,True,"
        Jan 2023 updated. Batman tested positive for heartworms so he is undergoing hearworm treatment. Donations are needed to help with his care. 

Batman was living on the streets on the West Coast of Florida. He stayed away from people and had to be trapped. He was likely dumped, mistreated and scared as he evaded capture for over a month.

His tail wiggles now when he sees people. He will be seeing a vet this week (Jan 16-21) for vetting and will be adoptable soon. He is fostered in Jacksonville, Florida.

18571684,Rat Terrier,Small,Male,Young,Short,Ray Ray (GA),,,False,True,True,"
        This dog's fosterhome is located in: Hazlehurst, GA  Ray-Ray (also known as Radar) is a smart, 20 month old boy - who doesn't always come when called. His fostermom says that he's is an adorable little “work in progress”. Ray Ray will be happiest in a home with a securely fenced yard. He would also like a family that knows and understands Terriers, and is prepared to spend time working with him on keeping up (and improving) his training and manners. Ray Ray is a fearless little guy, quick to chase anything he views as prey (cats, squirrels, rabbits, ""pocket pets"", etc). This little guy (only about 10 pounds) loves to play! In fact, he plays ""full blast"" with his foster siblings for most of the day. He also loves to snuggle up with his fostermom for a nap... after he's worn himself out with playing. Ray Ray can be very ""high energy"", and sometimes wants to nibble hands, so a family with older kids olny would be best for him. He is house trained (if kept to a schedule), and crate trained, too. Ray Ray's happy-go-lucky personality wins over everyone he meets. He's great with other dogs, and totally loves car rides. Are you up for the Ray Ray Challenge?

20506384,Rat Terrier,Small,Male,Senior,,Jimmy (VA),,,,True,True,"
        This dog's fosterhome is located in: Suffolk, VA 

Jimmy is what you'd call a real character. Rescued from a dark and dingy high kill 'animal care facility' within a very short time of being led to the gassing box the first thing he did upon being sprung was back kick the death dust from his feet. Jimmy has a dew claw on both hind legs and with these and the way his legs bow slightly when he walks he gives the rear view appearance of an ol' cow poke. The jingle of the tags on his collar provides just the right sound for the 'spurs' on his feet, and so his foster mom has taken to sometimes calling him ""Cowboy Jim"". This little dude is a 13 year young Jack/Rat (Jack Russell/ Rat Terrier mix) weighing only 8.5 pounds and in excellent health. He doesn't have a problem with other dogs and more often than not will join in on a game of tug of war or chase, but he also enjoys time alone meandering the yard or napping in the sun. He's learning about horses and how, like a good cowboy, not to bark at them, and he's fine around cats as long as they don't run from him... otherwise it's time for a round-up. As for people; He's friendly toward everyone outside his domain but is a little cautious when meeting someone for the first time. This is easily handled by reminding him that it's you in charge, not him. And as for children; He's actually very affectionate with little people 5 yrs & older. Children younger than 5 tend to make him a tad nervous. Jimmy is house, leash, and crate trained.... doesn't suffer from any phobias (i.e. separation anxiety), fear of thunderstorms, etc. And, he's not a digger, a climber, or an excessive barker. All in all he's a wonderful little wrangler with a big heart and a whole lot of appreciation for this second chance at life. He would do best in a home with a fenced yard, but would probably be okay in an apartment as well... so long as he's given daily walks and access to fresh air and sunshine. For more photos of Jimmy please click here. Thanks for considering this sweet little senior.

20588208,Rat Terrier,Small,Female,Adult,,Cammie (SC),,,False,True,True,"
        This dog's fosterhome is located in: Myrtle Beach, SC 

Cammie is a 3 yr old Rat Terrier mix. She is a robust 23 pounds, but needs to lose about 5 pounds to be a healthier weight. Cammie was picked up as a stray but it's obvious that she belonged to someone at some point in her life. She listens really well and knows ""sit"", ""down"", ""up"" and ""no"" - and is very smart.  Because of her life on the streets she was not totally trusting of all humans in the beginning, but she has made huge strides in getting more confident. She will greet new people with happy enthusiasm, and then she will sit cautiously and quietly while someone pets her. Cammie's good with other dogs but will be just fine alone, too. She likes to chase cats so a home without cats will be best for Cammie.  Because of her shy nature, her foster family feels that a home with older children only (or no children) would be the best for her. She’s house broken and crate trained, though she doesn't’t need to be crated when left alone. Cammie’s very good and not at all destructive. Although Cammie is shy and cautious, she does love to be with you on the couch or the bed, and is a wonderful snuggler. She also gives great “Cammie kisses”, and she always has a lot to give. Cammie can be playful and enjoys playing with stuffed toys, but in true Rattie fashion she will play and then settle down when you are ready for her to.  Cammie is a very sweet dog whose life didn’t start out so well, but with a little love and patience she will make an amazing companion for some very lucky person or people. More pix of Cammie can be seen here.

21524411,Rat Terrier,Small,Female,Adult,,Mia Shel (VA),False,False,False,True,True,"
        SENIORS For SENIORS CANDIDATE

My name is Mia. After years of living with my family in WV, they decided I was too much trouble and took me to this place where dogs just disappear. A lady came to the shelter to see who needed help and looked at me. She said I was cute with my under bite. I have been in a foster home for five years and I wish I had a home of my own.  I love to chase a ball, play tug of war, and best of all love to tear the insides out of stuffed  animals. I need someone who understands the terrier breed.  I tolerate all of the other dogs in my foster home but I won’t back down if confronted or if anyone (dog or human) tries to take my toy or try to sneak my food or treat .  I can’t be around cats as I would love to be able to catch those tempting things and shake them good. I would love to have all the attention just for me.  I can be in a crate for about 6 hours without going outside.  I sleep under the covers at night with mom and dad. I weigh about 15 lbs. and am between 12 and 13 years old. No children for me please! Here's a link to my photo album http://imageevent.com/rattiemom/miashel.

Our minimum suggested adoption fees for 2016 are: Adult Dogs $175, Puppies under 12 months of age $200, and American Hairless Terriers $225.

        This dog's fosterhome is located in: Richmond Hill, GA    Hi everyone..... my name is Jenny. I'm 3 years old, and everyone thinks I'm cute. I know I'm a sweet little girl. I really love other dogs and cats and people. I would do really good with kids over 8 years old. I'm a pretty small girl - the last time I weighed in I was almost 9 pounds! Fostermom says I could use a little more weight on me. I love attention. I will talk to you if I want your attention, especially if you're ignoring me. I really like sitting in your lap, and I'm just small enough to make a good fit. I do love to play a lot; I have this really small rope toy I play with, and I love a good game of tug. I am really just as sweet as I can be, and also I'm housebroken and not at all destructive. I'm over that puppy stage, so I don't chew on things I'm not supposed to. If you think I'm cute, and think I would be the dog for you, then please fill out an application and put my name on it. I sure would love to find my Forever home soon, so I could have a family to call my own; in return I would give them all the love they ever wanted. Here's a link to a  photo album that's all about me.

        This dog's fosterhome is located in: Richmond Hill, GA    My name is Mattie. I am 3 years old, and I'm very sweet and very snuggly. I was left in a cage in the back yard after my owner moved away. After 4 days a neighbor heard someone whining and it was me. I was taken to the animal shelter and my fostermom saw a picture of me and got me to her house. I lost a little bit of weight, but I am slowly putting it back on. I'm very quiet and well mannered, and shy with people at first. I'm also housebroken, and not a barker at all. I get along with other dogs and with cats, too. I will sit for a treat and I love to quietly jump up and lay by your side to cuddle. I will also play a little bit, but I'm very gentle with my playing. Here is a link to a photo album so you can see how pretty I am. I really would like a nice home to call my own.

22034718,Rat Terrier,Small,Male,Adult,,Stewart (NC),,,,True,True,"
        This dog's fosterhome is located in: Elizabeth City, NC    Stewart is a fun and feisty 1 year old who loves people, children, and other dogs.  He is uber-affectionate and would work well in a home with children to romp and play with him.  Stewie's vet thinks he is a full blooded Rat Terrier. He has a mostly white body with specks of black showing through (it's called ""ticking"").  Stewart's black face and tail look like he was dipped in black paint!  He has expressive brown eyes and the large ears of a true Rattie. Stewart's ears are not quite mature yet, and do turn down at times, giving him an endearing look. Stewie eats well, and since he was very skinny when he was rescued, has put on a good bit of weight.  He responds well to training with treats. Stewart has had a few accidents since he's been in his foster home, but he's working on fixing that; he is bright and wants to please, so it shouldn't take him too long. He rides well in the car and does not mind being picked up by his person. Stewart is definitely a snuggler, and loves to sit on fostermom's lap. It is our expert opinion that Stewart Ratbone would make someone a wonderful pet (though he will be missed by his foster parents). To see additional photos of Stewart please click here.

22732068,Rat Terrier,Small,Female,Adult,Short,Coco Belle (NC),,,,True,True,"
        This dog's fosterhome is located in: Charlotte, NC  
 Coco Belle is a gorgeous girl who was found wandering in a bad part of town. She was in very bad shape physically, and needed to gain weight; she also had lots of nasty intestinal worms. Coco Belle was immediately taken to the vet, and fortunately, she did not have heartworms! She now weighs a healthy 13 pounds, and for her that's pretty-much perfect. Coco Belle loves other dogs (big or small), and cats; she lives with a Bloodhound, a Rat Terrier & a Maine Coon cat who all play with each other, chase & sleep together. She loves to run in the yard, but it must have a secure fence; Coco Belle has to be leashed at all times when not in a fenced area or is likely to run off & get lost. Coco Belle appears to be about a year & a half old. She is white with pretty blue & chocolate brown markings. Click here to see more shots of pretty Coco Belle. The funniest thing about Coco Belle has to be the way she plays; she likes to smile & show her teeth - which makes her look like Cujo. She can be a little possessive with her toys or her person at times. Coco Belle is also a vacuum cleaner when it comes to eating her food & does not want another dog to come too close.  All in all, Coco Belle is a wonderful dog who is sweet and loving - and just needs a forever home to call her own.

23028600,Rat Terrier,Small,Female,Adult,Short,Catolina (NC),,,,True,True,"
        This dog's fosterhome is located in: Raleigh, NC 

Catolina (also known as Katie) is a spunky, 2 year old, 9 pound Rat Terrier. She loves her ""person"" and prefers to be your one and only. Katie loves to play and cuddle and has a puppy-ish personality. She barks like a little puppy when someone's at the door, but overall she is a quiet little girl when just hanging in the house. Catolina wants to be in whatever room you're in and loves to cuddle on the bed with you at night. She is working on housetraining still and uses the doggie door pretty well. Katie is a little shy with new people, but then warms up once hel, and will be the sweetest little girl. She does well with her fostermom's children, who are ages 3 and 9 - though she will not tolerate a young toddler trying to hug her, and will run away from such taunting; we feel she is best with older children who understand a dog's space. Catolina does well with other dogs within the fosterhome, but can be a little anxious with strange dogs. She is a true joy to have and will make a perfect pet companion for the right home. We feel that with a little more time and being exposed more to new things, she will truly blossom. Katie is also great with either a male or female owner - she's just a little shy when around strangers. If you are looking for a forever friend, this little lovebug could be the one to bring lots of joy to your family. For additional photos of Catolina please  click here.

        This dog's fosterhome is located in: Jacksonville, FL 

I want to share my love and snuggles with you! I'm only 3 years old, so I love to run around and play. If you give me a treat I'll jump three feet in the air! I know how to sit too, but it's hard when I'm so excited! I chase bugs and squirrels outside; they're my favorite to chase! If you're sitting on the couch, I would love to be right there with you and keep you company... so you don't get scared during scary movies! I love to snuggle in bed with you all night, but I am happy sleeping in my crate, too. I love playing with kids, even if they want to pull my ears.  I make sure everyone knows how much I love them by giving kisses out regularly.  So if you see me online, and you're my forever family, please tell Ratbone, because unfortunately I cannot type.  I can't wait to come home! You can see more pictures of me (I'm really cute!) by using this link.
